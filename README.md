# kendo-react-nextjs
An example of the KendoReact Grid(Table) in NextJS application.

Steps to run the application:

1) npm install
2) npm run dev


The `npm run build`, which uses NextJS, is not working because the package rxjs/webSocket runs only on the client. Some info here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43311238/javascript-referenceerror-websocket-is-not-defined
